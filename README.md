# My portfolio [View Live!](https://ylva-nilsson-portfolio.netlify.app/)
This week's project has been to build my own portfolio to show the world the wonders that I'm now capable of building. The portfolio shall contain feature projects that I have built so far and some information about myself and my background and my contact details.

In addition to creating HTML and CSS, the mission has also been to test our website

* Accessibility testing
* Cross-browser testing

## The process and structure

I decided to have three media queries which made it hard to decide on width for content and also which font-sizes and line-height to use.

For me this was a really heavy project to first come up with a good HTML and CSS structure to be able later on to create a responsive website. On this also keep up with the testing in a good way. I fell into the trap and got started too late. Felt tough when my profession is within quality assurance. I'm used with Cross-browser testing but accessibilty testing is a new area for me and especillay the screen reader part. Feels good to add that knowledge to my QA profession.

It's so hard to come up with good class names to create a clean CSS file. Mine has become to meassy.

So I have made a TO-DO list with general and section specific things to come back to later on in this Boot Camp to hopefully make it more final and get higher scores on accessibility.

This is what I have used for testing and tried to fix things that have been highlighted (doesn't mean that I still can have issues on my website)

**Accessibility**

* Screen reader - Chromevox
* Lighthouse
* [https://wave.webaim.org/](https://validator.w3.org/)
* [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/)

**Cross-browser**

* Chrome - Mac
* Firefox - Windows
* Edge - Windows
* iOS - iPone X (Safari)
* Android - Samsung S8 (Chrome)

### TO-DO list

**Lighthouse**

* Tag `<h5>` in footer - Heading elements are not in a sequentially-descending order
 
**validator.w3.org**

* Section & Article lacks heading - Replace? Ask code coaches if I should replace tem with tag `<div>`
* Possible misues of `aria-lable` - Replace? Ask code coaches bout it

**https://wave.webaim.org/**

* 4 X Very low contrast in header - fix to add opacity
* 4 X Suspicious alternative text in featured projects and my thoughts

**General**

* Use `text-transform: uppercase;` instead of writing my text in capital letters in HTML
* Update the site with my information about myself and my background and so on.
* Update ARIA if changing the content 

**Header**

* Add opacity to the background image to get better contrast to the text

**Summary**

* None

**Tech**

* None

**Featured projects**

* Add overlay on the images
* Better CSS styling to have space between elements

**Other projects**

* Better CSS styling to have space between elements

**My thoughts**

* Better CSS styling to have space between elements
* For mobile just show one "My thoughts" the other one shall added to "More thoughts" (toggle on/off)

**More thoughts**

* Add to the website

**Skills**

* Needs to be styled (just added content)

**For more**

* None

**Footer**

* Give some love with styling
* Add this `<a href="mailto:ylva.nilsson75@gmail.com">ylva.nilsson75@gmail.com</a>`
* iOS - Phone number need to add some specific stylining for iOS since it becomes a clickable link in blue color. So you barely see it.
