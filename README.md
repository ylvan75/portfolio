# My portfolio [View Live!]()
This week's project has been to build my own portfolio to show the world the wonders that I'm now capable of building. The portfolio shall contain feature projects that I have built so far and some information about myself and my background and my contact details.

In addition to creating HTML and CSS, the mission has also been to test our website

* Accessibility testing
* Cross-browser testing

## The process and structure

I decided to have have three media queries which I think made it hard to decide on width for the content and also which font-sizes and line-height to use.

For me this was a really heavy project to come up with a good HTML and CSS structure and start with mobile first and later on be able to scale your web-site to tablet and desktop and have it to be responsive.

So I have made a TO-DO list with general and section specific things to come back to later on in this Boot Camp to hopefully make it more final and get higher scores on accessibility.

### TO-DO list

**General**

* Use `text-transform: uppercase;` instead of writing my text in capital letters in HTML
* Update the site with my information about myself and my background and so on. 

**Header**

* Add opacity to the background image to get better contrast to the text
